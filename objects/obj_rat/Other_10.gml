			a: "Have you found anything yet? there might be an old [cr]bellows[ck] somewhere up here."	
			},
			
		Speak_2 : {
			a: "Hey! you found something! okay now this is going to sound a little weird but I want you to stick that in me and start pumping!",

//[+]============[+]	
	    Hold : {
			a: "The rat doesn't seem threatened by your approach, making it easy for you to pick it up.",
			b: "Holding the rat, it feels soft, both with it's thick fur but also with it being unusually squishy.",
			c: "it's body compresses and contorts as you squeeze it, like a big stress ball!",
			d: "The rat doesn't seem to mind being handled, it looks up to you with a warm expression.",
		},
//[+]============[+]	
		Hit : {
			a: "You take a swing at the rat, however you fists merely sink into the rat's body, it was like punching an air filled pillow!",
			b: "The Rat seems unphased by the action.",
		},
//[+]============[+]		
	    Inflate : {
			a: "You draw out your pump with the curious desire to try and inflate the rodent. conveniently, it rolled over to reveal a stopper in it's naval area.",
			b: "you tug it loose, causing air to escape before shoving the pump hose in, and you began to thrust the plunger, forcing air into the rodent.",
			c: "each push caused the rat to swell, steadily getting larger and larger.",
			d: "by the time you stop, the rat has gone from merely being the size of a dodgeball to being just as tall and 3 times as wide as you!",
		},

	Deflate: {
		a: "You unplug the stopper on the rat's naval, allowing the air to escape till he goes flat.",
		b: "with care, you place him into the bag.",
		},
