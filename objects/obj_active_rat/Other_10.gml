		a: "it's the rat! and he's a big one now! as big as you even!",

		a:"With your chosen device, you begin pumping more air into the rat",
		b:"it's body creaks and it's cheeks begin to swell as you force air into the already well overblown rodent, it's claws on it's paws and feet forced out from the high internal pressure.",
		c:"soon with each pump, the rodents rod begins to force it's way between it's legs, swelling further and further untill suddenly, it lets out a huge rush of air!",
		d:"as air escapes from the rat's dick, it begins to shrink down to it's original size, though still inflated, the rat appears relieved after having released all that overbuilt pressure."
